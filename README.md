# global_signal_regression_fmri

This is a code for Global Signal Regression of fMRI data. 
Based on: Fox et al., 2009. The Global Signal and Observed Anticorrelated Resting State Brain Networks. J. Neurophysiol.

Some researchers say global signal regression (GSR) is an extremely relevant step in fMRI data analysis, that must be performed 
in order to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and that it should be the standard for any fMRI analysis.

Some researchers say GSR is a horrible method that may contaminate the data and generate spurious results.

Your choice.
